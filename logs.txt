Ellipse-Identification Taken From Geeks2Geeks: 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-circles-and-ellipses-in-an-image-using-opencv-python/

They provide the code and some basic explanations for the parameters they explore 

Parameters: (do units matter?)
Area = Area of circle (to avoid erroneous classifications) 
Circularity = Triangle-onal to poolygonal to elliptical to circular 
Convexity = Heart-shaped to circular-shaped (whether or not shape bends in on itself)
Inertia = How squeezed the shape is (Circle = 1, ellipse in [0,1], line = 0)

Trial: Area | Circularity | Convexity | Inertia | Number of masks found 
1       100      0.1             0.2        0.01     2
2       100      0.2             0.2        0.01     2 // same blobs as 1
3       100      0.4             0.2        0.01     2  // same blobs as 1
4       100      0.6             0.2        0.01     0


# These were all done by hand, which is pretty slow way to check 

# WANT: 
# Let's get the computer to 
#   - estimate the best parameters (does that help?)
#   - search for blobs over a range of parameters 
 
 # grid_search to go over best parameter range
